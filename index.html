        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is <strong>Claire Sarcia (nicknamed: Al)</strong>, an aspiring <em>Media and Production director.</em> 
            I was born on the 17<sup>th</sup> of June in Manila, Philippines. 
            I moved to Oman when I was 3, where I spent most of my childhood growing up. 
            I am the eldest amongst my siblings.  I am fond of <em>music</em> like <abbr title="Original Pilipino Music">OPM</abbr> 
            and a few Indie Music.I <em>like</em> birds as pets more than dogs and some cats.
        </p>
        <p> I am <em>passionate</em> about arts, design, and its various forms. I find it very interesting and something worth appreciating.
            For as long as I can remember, art has always been an <em>integral part of my life.</em> It has brought me comfort 
            and joy whenever and wherever I am. Animated shows like <abbr title="Jujutsu Kaisen">JJK</abbr>, One Piece, 
            Demon Slayer, Ghibli Movies, etc. are some of the few shows that I enjoy watching.
